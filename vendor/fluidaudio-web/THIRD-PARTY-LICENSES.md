## parakeet.wgsl (MIT)

https://github.com/narcotic-sh/parakeet.wgsl
Copyright (c) 2026 Narcotic Software — MIT License.

Several load-bearing kernel designs in this project are adapted from
parakeet.wgsl, and its author's write-ups guided much of our optimization
work. Specifically:

- **Tile-major direct-B subgroup GEMM** (`GEMM_TM_WGSL` in
  `src/gpu/compute.js`) — the workhorse encoder kernel and our single
  largest speed win (+58% encode): weights prepacked
  `[N/256][K/32][32][32-pack]` and streamed direct from global memory with
  zero workgroup-memory staging and zero barriers, A rows distributed via
  `subgroupBroadcast`, f16 accumulation. Adapted from their
  `src/webgpu/kernels/gemm.ts` geometry.
- **GPU-resident TDT decoder** (`src/engines/asr-parakeet/gpu-decoder.js`,
  opt-in) — the whole greedy TDT loop in one dispatch, following their
  part-2 design.
- The earlier **subgroup-broadcast GEMM** experiments and the batching /
  fused-attention studies were run against their published implementation
  as the reference point.

If this project interests you, check out theirs — it is an excellent,
fast, focused Parakeet implementation for the browser.

## ace-step-1.5.wgsl (MIT)

Upstream repo not yet public (author's live demo: https://acestep.narcotic.sh);
the complete vendored source is in this repository at `packages/acestep`.
Copyright (c) 2026 Narcotic Software (Hamza Qayyum) — MIT License.

The entire music-generation runtime (`packages/acestep`) is a vendored
import of ace-step-1.5.wgsl, and the `/music` page's worker backend
(`src/engines/musicgen-acestep/direct-only-backend.ts`, the generated
semantic-validation tensor metadata, and the download-progress accounting)
is adapted from its companion demo. The complete upstream license and the
ACE-Step / Qwen model-artifact terms are preserved in
`packages/acestep/LICENSE` and `packages/acestep/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`.
Model weights retain their upstream ACE-Step and Qwen licenses.

## DiCoSe.wgsl (MIT)

Upstream repo currently ships no LICENSE file (its package.json declares
MIT; the license text is pending from the author and will be added at
`packages/dicose/LICENSE` when supplied). The complete vendored source is
in this repository at `packages/dicose`.
Copyright (c) 2026 Hamza Qayyum (Narcotic Software) — MIT License.

The entire stem-separation runtime (`packages/dicose`) is a vendored
import of DiCoSe.wgsl by **Hamza Qayyum**: a raw WebGPU WGSL port of
DiCoSe (BS-RoFormer + one-step consistency-distilled refinement,
arXiv 2412.06965) with its own correctness-audited optimization ledger
(`packages/dicose/optimization/`). The `stem-dicose` engine and the
`/music` page's Split stems feature are thin wrappers over his worker
client. Model weights are converted from the
[karchkha/DiCoSe](https://huggingface.co/karchkha/DiCoSe) checkpoints
(MIT) via `packages/dicose/model/convert.py` and retain their upstream
license.

## parakeet.js / ysdede (MIT)

https://github.com/ysdede/parakeet.js — the NeMo log-mel preprocessor in
`src/engines/asr-nemotron/nemotron-mel.js` is adapted from its mel.js
(MIT), and several model vocabularies are fetched from ysdede's ONNX
export repos at runtime.
